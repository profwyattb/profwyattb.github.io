### Technologies
- 🚤 NextJS: The best React framework! This was my first project where I properly got to grips with it.
- ⌨ Typescript: Supercharges your JavaScript code with types and really really good linting.
- ✈ SWR: Keeps the current playing song up to date.
- 🎨 TailwindCSS + twin.macro: One of the nicest combos for React styling.
- 💅 Styled components: For times when custom CSS was needed.
- 🦘 Animate.css: For the fancy animations.
